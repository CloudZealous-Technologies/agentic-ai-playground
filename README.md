# 🧠 Agentic AI Playground

Welcome to the **Agentic AI Playground** — a public repository where I explore autonomous agent systems, pattens and specifications, tool-using LLMs, and multi-agent collaboration. This project serves as a testing ground for:

- 🧩 **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** communication
- 📦 **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for agent memory and instructions
- 🛠️ Tool integration (APIs, databases, functions)
- 🧭 Planning, reasoning, and multi-step execution

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Showcase end-to-end agentic workflows
- Compare frameworks like **LangGraph**, **AutoGen**, **CrewAI**, and **Agno**
- Experiment with context formatting, delegation, and memory
- Provide reusable examples for developers building with LLM agents
